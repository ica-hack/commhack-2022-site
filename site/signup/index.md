We are excited that you would like to join us for the Hackathon at ICA 2025! Due to overwhelming interest last year, we are instituting a two-step application process for the hackathon. The first step is to fill out the application form linked below. By mid-February we will reach out to applicants to provide the link to register for the pre-conference through ICA.

We have a much larger space this year than we did in Paris, so we are optimistic that we will be able to accept everyone who applies. If, however, we receive more applications than we can accommodate, we will prioritize applications from students and those from underrepresented groups. We will also prioritize applications from those who have not previously attended the hackathon.
